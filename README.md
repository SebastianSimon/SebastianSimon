## What languages?

* JavaScript, HTML, CSS: A lot.
  
  I started learning about Web technologies since the age of 12.
  This shaped my interests and hobbies and led me to enrol into a [BSc computer science program](https://github.com/SebastianSimon/SebastianSimon/wiki/My-BSc-computer-science-degree).
  Today, I feel like I’ve read almost all of the [ECMA-262 spec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) at least twice.
  JS is the language I feel most comfortable with.

  * jQuery
  * GreaseMonkey
  * Node.js
  * Bootstrap
* Regexes: Yep.
* Markdown: Yep.
* TypeScript: Quite a bit.
* Bash: Quite a bit.
  * Linux
* LaTeX: Kinda.
* SQL: Kinda.
* Python: Kinda.
* PHP: Kinda.
  * Symphony
  * Twig
* Rust: Started learning it.
* C: A bit.
* C++: A bit.
* Java: A bit.
